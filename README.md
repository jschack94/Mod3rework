Take a Hike is a web application that helps users organize and find hikes that they have completed. If you would like to create and exchange information on hikes, you can sign up. 


## Installing Locally

1. Follow on the links for both the [frontend](https://github.com/jschack94/Take-a-Hike-Ruby-on-Rails).
2. Clone.
3. In the command line, `cd` into the folder and run `bundle install`.
4. Run `rails s` to start your backend server. It should run on `localhost:3000`.


## Features

* A user can sign up/log in.

* A user can go to their 'Profile' page to edit their info or sign up as a mentor (otherwise, the user will only be a mentee by default).

* A user can browse and see the mentors available in their area.

* A user can request mentorship from mentors.

* A notification will show up for the mentor who was sent a request immediately. The mentor can then have the option to accept or decline the mentorship. Meanwhile, the 'Request Mentorship' button will be disabled and the mentee won't be able to request mentorship from that mentor again (until the request has been declined).
